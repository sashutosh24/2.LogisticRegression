# Logistic Regression Classification Project

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify binary target data. The report includes model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and feature importance. This project uses Python with libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify data into two categories using logistic regression. We also analyze feature importance to understand which variables most significantly impact the model's predictions.

Key functionalities include:
1. **Training a Logistic Regression Model**.
2. **Evaluating Model Performance**: Generates metrics like accuracy and classification report.
3. **Analyzing Feature Importance**: Outputs coefficients of the logistic regression model.
